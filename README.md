# CreditCard-Fraude-detections
This is a project based on the project provided By Luis Otávio of the youtube channel Luis Otávio.Pro (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC3Vw7R-fKS-uYXYRhJ983A).

The database if from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and consists of transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

This data were modified by Luis Otavio and it is not equal to eh original database.
Here I follow the script and aplication from Luis Otavio and made some changes according to my preferences in analysing. In the Luis Otavio channel he presents a video-aula (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSnPkYnaH4E&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=LuisOtavio) about this example.
